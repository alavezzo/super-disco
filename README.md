This daily planner allows the user to enter in tasks for each hour of the workday. The hour time-blocks are color coded to indicate the status of the task. Past hours are greyed out. The current hour is in red. Hours set in the future are green. 

When a task is entered into the planner, it is saved to local storage. When the user returns to the planner, previously entered tasks are loaded. Each new day, the local storage is cleared and a fresh planner is available for use.
